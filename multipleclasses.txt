#MUTLIPLE_CLASSES 1.1 - Intro to multiple CSS classes
Hey Chris from Codify Academy here, in this video I want to explore what happens when we add two or more classes to an element.


#MUTLIPLE_CLASSES 1.2 - Why use multiple CSS classes
Elements in HTML can have an unlimited number of class attribute values,
as long as each value is separated by a space.

We can added styles that we use regularly to a class and layer on additional styles from other classes.


#MUTLIPLE_CLASSES 1.3 - How to use multiple CSS classes
I almost always create a class of .text-center and set the text-align property to center. and I want to center an element I can add the class of text-center to it.

Lets look at these buttons for another example.

Let's assume we want all of our buttons to have a font size of 16 pixels, we can create a class to apply that to our buttons.

and we'll also add some padding.

Here you can see the two anchor elements, both with multiple class attribute values. The first class, btn, is used to apply a font size and padding to the elements.

Then, the first anchor element with the additional class of btn-danger has a red background color applied while the second anchor element with the additional class of btn-success has  a green background color applied.

this will allow you reuse some of your code and make it easier to read.





#MUTLIPLE_CLASSES 1.4 - Outro to multiple CSS classes
By using multiple classes, we can layer on as many styles on an element as we want, this will keep our code lean and the specificity weights low.

Just like understanding the cascade and calculating specificity, this is a practice that will take time to fully absorb, but you'll get better with each line you write.
